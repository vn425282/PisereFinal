# Web Frontend - Take Home Test

【Assignment】 Front Web Developer (Mr. Tri Nguyen)
* This project using React, Redux for State Management

## Install Library

```
1. npm install
2. npm serve
```

## Uses case

- The user should be able to search by keyword for images<br />
- Images should be shown in a grid with consistent width and height images, without<br />
stretching the images (cropping is ok, so long as the image fills the grid space), with a
default maximum of 8 images shown per search<br />
- The user should be able to add and remove a tag from images to mark or unmark
them as a favourite image<br />
- Different app states should ideally be accounted for with UI feedback to the user, e.g.
errors, loading, etc<br />
The client also had a few other features in mind, but considered these as secondary and only
required if we’re able to fulfil the above requirements:<br />
- Add a “Fetch More” button displayed below the results that will fetch the next 8
image results for the current search<br />
- A dedicated page that the user can go to to view their tagged favourite images at
any time<br />
